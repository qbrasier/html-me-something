			<header>a brief history</header>
			<p>
				wikipedia has been on the world wide web for a long time. at least 10 years and possibly even more. in the days before the internet when someone wanted to learn about things in a similar fashion they would purchase large sets of books called <i>encylopedias</i>. this was generally expensive and brought with it a few downsides. for one you were forced to also own a bookshelf on which to store these books. additionally when you wanted to learn about something specific then you would have to manually search through pages of a real, physical book which could be tedious, and you might not even find what you were looking for at all. wikipedia has a built in search bar you can use to find anything you want nearly instantly.

			<header>what the point of it is</header> 
			<p>
					basically wikipedia is a non-profit website that tries to freely distribute information to its users. it also strives to have well written articles, well cited facts, and no conjecture.
				wikipedia exists in an effort to let people learn for free. wikipedia's mission statement is the following: 
				<blockquote cite=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Purpose">"Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by acting as an encyclopedia, a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge. The goal of a Wikipedia article is to present a neutrally written summary of existing mainstream knowledge in a fair and accurate manner with a straightforward, "just-the-facts style". Articles should have an encyclopedic style with a formal tone instead of essay-like, argumentative, promotional or opinionated writing."</blockquote>

			<header>what kind of things are on wikipedia</header>
			<p>
				wikipedia contains information about all sorts of things, almost anything you could think of.
				a few examples:
				<ul>music</ul>
				<ul>videogames</ul>
				<ul>food</ul>
				<ul>the ocean</ul>
				<ul>countries</ul>

			<p>
				jimmy wales is the founder of wikipedia. a picture of him will be posted to the top of the website once a year asking people to donate money. they do this because they don't generate revenue and need money in order to run the servers.

			<header>who can use wikipedia</header>
